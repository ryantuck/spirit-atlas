	<p>When you think Tim McGraw</p>
	<p>I hope you think my favorite song</p>
	<p>The one we danced to all night long</p>
	<p>The moon like a spotlight on the lake</p>
	<p>When you think happiness</p>
	<p>I hope you think that little black dress</p>
	<p>Think of my head on your chest</p>
	<p>And my old faded blue jeans</p>
	<p>Yea when you think Tim McGraw</p>
	<p>I hope you think of me</p>
