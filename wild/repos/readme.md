# Repos (2025 snapshot)


100 Total = 8 private, 16 forks, 76 public

Repo history is nostalgic. Persisting now so I can rip things out. Probably archive by default.


## Private

aat - ok

fin - data out, theoretically public

google-takeout - public?

resume - public?

notes - wild?

finance-parsing - R stuff


## Forks

Only lookmlint worth keeping.

Most are just worth starring - gspread, lkml.vim, sqlfluff, tldr.

General Assembly stuff, settlers of catan, luigi had my first open-source PR, sparkfun LED stuff. Cute.

Done.


## Public

Lots of these.
