i once knew a *****
his real name was *******
his primary concern
was ********* * *********

being the illest *******
the world ever seen
he used to **** ****** *****
and ***** **** in his dreams

a corrupted young mind at the age of 13
***** neva had a fatha and his mom was * ******
she put the **** down but for every year she was sober
her son's heart simultaneously grew colder

...

any ******* wit a ******** can bust slugs
any ****** ******** can act like a thug
only a real **** can **** ******** **** **** ****
********* staring straight into they eye

***** knew these men were well-guarded
and they wanted to test him before business started
suggested ******* ********
to prove he was cold-hearted

...


***** was made to go first
but each of them took a turn
*********** *********** and **********
til ******************* *******************


but what he saw made him cringe and stutta
because he was staring into the eyes of his own *******
**** looked back at him and cried because he had forsaken ****
**** cried more violently than when they was *********** ****


his whole world stopped

and he remembered how his mom used to come home late
workin hard for nothin
cause now what was he worth


billy stepped back and cried out to the sky
cause he was lonely and scared
but only the devil responded cuz god wasn't there
and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul


cuz i was there when ***** and I ****** ***** **********
and now the devil follows me everywhere that i go
in fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
in every street cypher listening to little thugs flow


and you'll be one of god's children
that fell from the top
there's no diversity
because we're burning in the melting pot

so when the devil wants to dance wit you
you betta say neva
cuz a dance wit the devil
might last you foreva
